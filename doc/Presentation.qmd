## Introduction

Genome-wide transcriptional effects in RA (rheumatoid arthritis) patients, undergoing treatment with several disease-modifying drugs (DMARDs).

What are the genetic differences in RA patients, before and after DMARD treatment?

## Materials and Methods

Picture flow chart here

## Results: Differential expressed regulators

From the data in table 1 and 2, it can be seen that there is a difference in regulator expression before and after treatment.

## Results: Differential expressed regulators before treatment

First, the plot below shows the genetic expression levels in RA patients, before DMARD treatment.

## Results: Differential expressed regulators after treatment

Secondly, we show genetic expression levels in RA patients, after DMARD treatment.

## Results: Differential expressed regulators after treatment

Lastly, we show a comparison plot to indicate genetic differences as a result of treatment.

## Results: Target molecules

The upstream regulators consisted of several types of biological molecules, serving various functions.

## Results: Molecular mechanisms

A module is a cluster of related genes, either with related function, common transcriptional regulation, or selectively co-expressed in certain cell types.

## Results: Molecular mechanisms

From this plot, TGFB1 can be a potential drug target.

## Discussion

The study by Walsh et.al. found 292 genes down-regulated due to treatment, and 23 up-regulated. The down regulated genes are related to the immune system, a.o. T-cell activating-genes.

This can be explained due to the fact that RA is an auto-immune disease. Less disease activity means less immune activity, and vice versa.

The genetic regulation is based on RA patients, compared to healthy control samples.

## Our findings

We identified TGFB1 as a potential drug target.

This finding is based on RA patients before and after DMARD treatment.

TGFB1, and its corresponding "module 2" molecules, are potential drug targets for further investigation.
