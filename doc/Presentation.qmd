## Introduction

Genome-wide transcriptional effects in RA (rheumatoid arthritis) patients, undergoing treatment with several disease-modifying drugs (DMARDs).

Purpose: What are the genetic differences in RA patients, before and after DMARD treatment?

## Materials and methods

## Results: Differential expressed regulators

Does DMARD treatment affect expression levels?

## Results: Differential expressed regulators

What are the differences in genetic expression levels in RA patients, compared to healthy control samples?
