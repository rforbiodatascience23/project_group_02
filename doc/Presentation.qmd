## Introduction

Genome-wide transcriptional effects in RA (rheumatoid arthritis) patients, undergoing treatment with several disease-modifying drugs (DMARDs).

Purpose: What are the genetic differences in RA patients, before and after DMARD treatment?

## Materials and methods

## Results: Differential expressed regulators

Does DMARD treatment affect expression levels?

Yes, the variance decreases.

## Results: Differential expressed regulators

What are the differences in genetic expression levels in RA patients, compared to healthy control samples?

Although treated, significant differences remain. 
Unique patterns of significance.

## Results: Differential expressed regulators due to treatment

What are the differences in genetic expression levels in RA patients, before and after DMARD treatment?

Some upstream regulators are more affected than others.
Eight were chosen: IGF2, LIPE, MLK2, OLR1, PTPRC, RNASE2, S100A9, and TLR2.

## Results: Target molecules

What types of biological molecules are the common upstream regulators?

![](images/04_pie_chart.png){fig-align="center"}

Predominantly transcription regulators.

## Results: Target molecules

How does the treatment change the influence of the upstream regulators?

![](images/06_targets_plot-03.png){fig-align="center"}

Interesting regulators: LIPE, OLR1, and S100A9.

## Results: Molecular mechanisms

Which modules are the target molecules involved in?

![](images/06_modules_plot-02.png){fig-align="center"}

Predominantly module 2.
