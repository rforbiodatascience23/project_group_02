# Introduction {background-color="#806040"}

## Background Information {background-color="#806040"}

The study looked into genome-wide transcriptional effects in RA (rheumatoid arthritis) patients who are taking several disease-modifying drugs (DMARDs). Many genes, traget molecules, and cellular pathways were identified. We were curious which of the genes are significantly differential expressed, before and after DMARD treatment.

# Materials and Methods {background-color="#806040"}

## Preparing the data {background-color="#806040"}

From the provided data, we were interested in Supplementary table 3, containing identified regulator molecules from before and after DMARD treatment.
The data table consisted of two separate parts, each part representing before and after treatment, respectively.
