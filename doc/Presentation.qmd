# Introduction

## Background Information

The study looked into genome-wide transcriptional effects in RA (rheumatoid arthritis) patients who are taking several disease-modifying drugs (DMARDs).
Many genes, traget molecules, and cellular pathways were identified. We were curious which of the genes are significantly different expression before and after DMARD treatment.

# Materials and Methods

## The used data

From the provided data, we were interested in Supplementary table 3, containing identified regulator molecules from before and after DMARD treatment.
