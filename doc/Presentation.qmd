## Introduction

Genome-wide transcriptional effects in RA (rheumatoid arthritis) patients, undergoing treatment with several disease-modifying drugs (DMARDs).

Purpose: What are the genetic differences in RA patients, before and after DMARD treatment?

## Materials and methods

## Results: Differential expressed regulators

From the data in table 1 and 2, it can be seen that there is a difference in regulator expression before and after treatment.

## Results: Differential expressed regulators

The plots below shows the genetic expression levels in RA patients, before and after DMARD treatment.

## Results: Target molecules

The upstream regulators consisted of several types of biological molecules, serving various functions.

## Results: Molecular mechanisms

A module is a cluster of related genes, either with related function, common transcriptional regulation, or selectively co-expressed in certain cell types.

## Discussion

The study by Walsh et.al. found 292 genes down-regulated due to treatment, and 23 up-regulated. The down regulated genes are related to the immune system, a.o. T-cell activating-genes.

We identified LIPE , OLR1, and S100A9 as a potential drug targets. These molecules, and their corresponding module, module 2, are potential drug targets for further investigation.
